Aroid is an open-source four-wheeled robot with self-driving abilities that can navigate green coloured roads autonomously while avoiding obstacles. All the code, circuit diagrams, hardware list is freely available on Github.

**Building Cost:** ~80USD

**Capabilities of Aroid include:**

- Navigating green coloured paths autonomously.
- Avoiding obstacles in the path / not running into things.
- Accurately knowing how far it has travelled (odometry) and in what direction it has travelled.
- Sensing what direction is robot heading.
- Moving exact distances as it is asked to.
- Building a map/history of the trajectory the robot has taken to get to the current position while navigating paths autonomously (as of now the robot has required data but I didn’t get enough time to write code for visualizing this data).
- Ability to look in different directions and sense objects in front of it.
- Ability to be controlled remotely (wirelessly) from anywhere.
- Ability to sense light levels and temperature of the environment the robot is located in.
- Ability to send sensory readings to a remote when requested.
